# Push_Karma
-A place to keep all of my Push_Chop and Push_Karma devices. 

I will use this to track bugs, versions and features. 

Each Instance takes control of part of the PUSH according to the ROW setting. The matrix is split into 4 groups of two rows, and the corresponding scene launch buttons, and the two track select and track state buttons above. For instance if you select Row 1, then this looper will be controlled by the first two rows of the matrix, the two scene launch buttons, the first two encoders and the first 2 columns of the smaller rectangular buttons at top. 

Press the Tap Tempo button on the Push to control these devices. Press the Metronome button to enable the encoders and display. 

The two top buttons control recording. The first button controls the loop recording. Hold the button to Arm, Press it again to record. While playing ine press overdubs, holding the button clears the loop and arms it for recordign This button is subject to the quantization set by the Record Quantize menu. The second button records button presses into a sequence, one press records, and then automatically starts playing back after the length defined by the Sequence parameter. When playing any press in that row will be recorded into the sequence.  Another press deletes the sequence.

The button matrix divides the loop into 16 slices, which you can trigger by hitting a button. This is subject to the button quantize parameter. 

The top scene button toggles between one-shot, and normal looping mode.
The bottom scene button reverse playback. This control is subject to the Button Quantize parameter. 

The Encoders give control over playback speed and stuttering. When you touch one of the encoders the effect will engage. When released the loop will play back normally. The left Ecnoder scales your playback speed from .01 - 8.0. The right enocder scales the rate of stuttering from 0.01 - 8. Both of these values are dependent on how fast the loop is playing via the speed buttons.
